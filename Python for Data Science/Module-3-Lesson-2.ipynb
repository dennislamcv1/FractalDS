    "### Lesson 2: Understanding Data Distributions\n",
    "- In this lesson, we are going to discuss some of the common shapes of the data distributions that we see in real time applications.\n",
    "- Data distribution refers to the way data points are spread or distributed across different values in a dataset. In other words, it describes the pattern or shape that the data takes on when plotted on a graph. Understanding the distribution of data is essential for gaining insights into the characteristics of the data, making informed decisions, and selecting appropriate statistical methods for analysis.\n",
    "- One of the key aspects of a data distribution include *probability distribution*.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Let us understand few key words now.\n",
    "- **Random experiment:** \n",
    "    - It is a process or procedure that generates outcomes in an unpredictable manner. \n",
    "    - It's a fundamental concept in probability theory and is used to study and model uncertain events. \n",
    "    - Random experiments are essential for understanding and quantifying uncertainty in various real-world situations.\n",
    "- **Random variable:** \n",
    "    - It is the outcome of random experiment. \n",
    "    - That is, random variable is a variable whose value is determined by chance, but it can take one of the values out of several possible outcomes of a random experiment. \n",
    "    - For example, tossing a coin is a random experiment, and the random variable may have the value head or tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability distribution:** \n",
    "    - It is a mathematical function that defines the likelihood of different outcomes or events in a random experiment or process. \n",
    "    - In simpler terms, a probability distribution tells us how likely different outcomes are to occur. \n",
    "    - It assigns probabilities to different possible values or ranges of values that a random variable can take on. \n",
    "    - Two important types of probability distributions are:\n",
    "        - **Discrete Probability Distribution:** This type of distribution deals with discrete random variables, which can only take specific, distinct values. Examples include the binomial distribution (for counting successes in a fixed number of trials) and the Poisson distribution (for counting rare events occurring in a fixed interval).\n",
    "        - **Continuous Probability Distribution:** These distributions are associated with continuous random variables, which can take any value within a certain range. Examples include the normal distribution (often called the bell curve), which is commonly used to model various natural phenomena like heights and weights.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "**In the couple of few lectures, we will see few important distributions and their features and use-cases in real time.**"

    "- A single success/failure experiment is also called a Bernoulli trial or Bernoulli experiment. That is, when n = 1, the binomial distribution is a Bernoulli distribution.\n",
